# Maximum-Subarray-Sum-Finder
This program prompts the user to input nine numbers and calculates the maximum sum among all possible subarrays of four consecutive numbers. It initializes a list to store user inputs and iteratively collects these numbers. The program then identifies the subarray with the maximum sum, displaying both the specific subarray and the calculated sum. Offering insight into contiguous sequences with the highest sums, this tool aids in analyzing and understanding the patterns within the provided numerical data.
